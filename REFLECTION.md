The following are my reflections: 

* What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

I learned how to use functions like `reduce`, `map`, and `filter` to work with lists in JavaScript. These functions help make the code shorter and easier to read. I also saw how to write functions to do specific tasks and how to use those functions together to get more done.

* What was the most confusing part?

The `reduce` function was difficult to understand how to use initially. It was hard to understand how it adds up all the numbers in the list. After slowly stepping through the individual steps it takes to accumulate the total, how it worked in totalTime made more sense.
